            <p>Are you a big fan of the classic Sega Genesis game Ecco the Dolphin? Don't you wish you had a way to edit the text they use in the game to make it say anything you wanted? Well my friend, worry no longer, the Ecco the Dolphin Text Generator is here! Enter your text in the box below and view your masterpiece. To download, right click on the picture and choose 'Save image as...'</p> 
            <p>Note: Only letters and some punctuation are allowed. Unfortunately, there were no numbers or other various types of symbols available in the game. This is a work in progress, so the image doesn't always update with each letter.</p>
