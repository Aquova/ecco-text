Text generation in the style of *Ecco the Dolphin* for Sega Genesis

https://aquova.github.io/ecco-text/

Are you a big fan of the classic Sega Genesis game *Ecco the Dolphin?* Don't you wish you had a way to edit the text they use in the game to make it say anything you wanted? Well my friend, worry no longer, the Ecco the Dolphin Text Generator is here!

This repository contains two programs that accomplish the same task. First there is the code for a web page where users can input text, view the results live, and download their image, which can be viewed at the above link.


Secondly, there is a Python script that takes user input, and saves their text in the Ecco style. This was originally included as part of my *Aquobot* program, but I've modified it to be a standalone program. This is included for completeness.
